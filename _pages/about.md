I am Heming Xia (Â§èÈπ§Êòé), a Ph.D. student in the [NLP Group](https://polyunlp.github.io/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by Prof. [Wenjie Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/). I earned my master's degree from the [MOE Key Lab of Computational Linguistics](https://icl.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, advised by Prof. [Zhifang Sui](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1226/2014.htm). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree from the [School of Physics](http://english.phy.pku.edu.cn/info/1017/5151.htm) at Peking University in 2020. I have also worked as a Research Intern at the [NLC Group @ Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/), where I had the privilege of collaborating with Dr. [Tao Ge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LYbs7Q8AAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I am an intern at [SEA AI Lab](https://sail.sea.com/), working closely with Dr. [Cunxiao Du](https://nonvolatilememory.github.io/).
